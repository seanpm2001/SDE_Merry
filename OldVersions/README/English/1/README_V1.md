## About

SDE Merry is a software engine designed to enable and support carousel user interfaces for the S Desktop Environment. I was recently inspired to work with a carousel user interface, after an interest spark a few days ago (on 2023, Wednesday, March 1st) as I noted that no mainstream/popular (or semi-popular) desktop user interface has used the carousel layout since 2015, the last one being the operating system for the original Amazon Kindle Fire, which was a heavy inspiration for this project.

A carousel user interface will be one of the GUI options for skeuowie/SDE. It is an optional interface, and isn't the primary GUI in the source package, but distribution makers can change this on their own basis.

## Languages

The Merry engine is written in Python, C, and Pony. 

Python is used for the application layer, C is used for the system level, and Pony is used additionally at the application level for uniqueness. Each app is tied to a pony.

## Variants

Different variants of the Carousel are planned/under development. They are built on top of Merry. They include:
